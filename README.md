# Windows_File_Toggle
Windows mod to enable File Extension and Hidden File toggling.

Adam's Windows Mods 2 - Toggle file extensions & hidden files.
These somewhat emulate how Ubuntu's file manager works for showing/hiding files and extensions.

Requires AutoHotKey - https://autohotkey.com/

Maps Windows Key + Y to toggle visible file extensions and Windows Key + H to toggle hidden files.

Copy this file to Startup to have it always run with your machine:
